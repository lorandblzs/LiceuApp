# LiceuApp (High school database management app, display language is Romanian)
basic app created while learning C#, 

- connects to an SQL DB
- simple log in page and login check (compares input usaer and password to the one in DB)
- extracts data from DB and displays it in dataGridView and on the form via labels, pictures as well
- can filter the displayed data
- adds new data to de DB
- updates data in DB
- deletes data from DB

- if you want to see it in action i have included a backup from the database in the "Resorces" folder ( yes with a typo :) ) named Licep_29-05-2023.bak
- you will have to update the Sql connection string to yours in the App.config

- all the data in the DB is fictional
